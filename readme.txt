This game is a satirical Fetus Simulator.
As creators of 'Abort Me' we believe in freedom of speech and irony,
 not in censorship.

Do not follow any of elements of this game in real life!
Are we clear? Cool.

_______________________________________

Feed the fetus to born it or just abort it - do whatever you want. It is a game, so you can always start again. Not like in real life.

Have fun and do not take things so seriously. Life is too short to waste it for pointless crusades.
